## FAQs

**Who is this for?**
Everyone! No prior knowledge of code is required - this event should be fun even if you’re not an experienced programmer. To participate in the event, you are only required to be interested in CS and learning more about that.

**How can I participate?**
Attend talks and workshops, earn points, and submit a project for the hackathon! Not everything is required though - you can choose the things you would like to do.

**Do I have to attend everything?**
Absolutely not! You can and should pick and choose the workshops that are interesting to you and attend those.

**Do I have to submit a project?**
No! If you’d only like to attend the workshops and events, that is fine too. We do recommend trying to build a project however, even if it’s something simple. Feel free to reach out to one of the mods for coming up with an idea!

**I’m still not sure if I should join...**
No worries! Reach out to one of the mods, like @Zachary or @Madhav, and have a chat with them to see what stuff you might enjoy at the event. Have fun, and feel free to drop by!
