## Overview

During the event, there will be lots of talks and workshops that we'll be hosting, ranging across various topics and fields. We plan to have plenty of workshops for all levels of coders, from beginners to pros, so that everyone can enjoy and learn something new!

There will also be a hackathon where you can build a project of your choice. Don't let this intimidate you though, because it'll be fun!

## Hackathon - Build a project

Throughout the week, you can build a project of your choice, with help and guidance from us as needed. The project could be of any size, and could be really, really simple. It doesn't have to be anything fancy â€” just have fun, learn, and build something!

For the competition, here are a few guidelines:

- Teams should be 1 - 4 people.
- Have your project be in a GitHub repo with a README, in order to share it.
- Projects should to be presented to the judges on Wednesday, December 30 ([see schedule below](#schedule)).

DO NOT worry if this does not make sense to you just yet, because we'll go over this in one of the workshops. And, don't hesitate to reach out to us!

## Activity Competition - Just participate!

This competition is meant for everyone, especially those who may not be experienced programmers. You earn points for doing all kinds of activities, and the participants with the most points will win a prize. Hereâ€™s how you get points:

| Activity                     | Points            |
|------------------------------|-------------------|
| Refer a friend               | 5 points / person |
| Attend a talk or workshop    | 10 points         |
| Do an activity in a workshop | 10 points         |
| Build a hackathon project    | 50 points         |

*By the way, you don't need to compete in the hackathon in order to get points for building a project. Simply building it and sharing it with us will be enough!*

## FAQs

**Who is this for?**

Everyone! The events should be fun even if youâ€™re not an experienced programmer. To participate, you only need to be interested in learning cool new stuff!

**How do I join?**

The hackathon will be hosted on Discord, in the CS Club Server. [**Click here to join the Discord server**](https://discord.com/invite/graRNeE), and ask for the @hacker role! Feel free to email [info@foothillcs.club](mailto:info@foothillcs.club) for assistance.

**How can I participate?**

Attend talks and workshops, earn activity points, and build a project for the hackathon! Not everything is required though - you can choose the things you would like to do.

**Do I have to attend everything?**

Absolutely not! You can pick and choose the talks, workshops, and activities that are interesting to you and attend those.

**Do I have to submit a project?**

No! If youâ€™d only like to attend the workshops and events, that's ok. We do recommend building a project, however, even if itâ€™s something small or simple. Feel free to reach out to one of the @mods to come up with an idea!
