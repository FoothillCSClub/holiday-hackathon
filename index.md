## FAQs

**Who is this for?**

Everyone! No prior knowledge of code is required - this event should be fun even if youâ€™re not an experienced programmer. To participate in the event, you are only required to be interested in CS and learning more about that.

**How can I participate?**

Attend talks and workshops, earn points, and submit a project for the hackathon! Not everything is required though - you can choose the things you would like to do.

**Do I have to attend everything?**

Absolutely not! You can and should pick and choose the workshops that are interesting to you and attend those.

**Do I have to submit a project?**

No! If youâ€™d only like to attend the workshops and events, that is fine too. We do recommend trying to build a project however, even if itâ€™s something simple. Feel free to reach out to one of the mods for coming up with an idea!

**Iâ€™m still not sure if I should join...**

No worries! Reach out to one of the mods, like @Zachary or @Madhav, and have a chat with them to see what stuff you might enjoy at the event. Have fun, and feel free to drop by!
